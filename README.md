# WORDPRESS-SITE

A Wordpress web site created during an apprenticeship at the end of 2016.

I chose one of the Wordpress themes available online and took some of its code to create my own theme from scratch. jQuery Validation Plugin and some WP plugins were used, e.g. to create multiple language versions, deal with comments and surveys. I also used PHP and phpMyAdmin to manage MySQL databases, as well as xampp to develop locally.

The site is responsive, has some nice animations and two language versions to choose from. Additionally, adding texts and uploading photos is possible right through the Wordpress admin panel, which was adjusted by me.

As the site has photos, logos and texts connected with an existing company project, I had to hide some content on the pictures.

Even though creating this web site was a useful experience, I am not a big fan of Wordpress development.
