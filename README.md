# WORDPRESS-SITE

A Wordpress web site created during an apprenticeship at the end of 2016.

I chose one of the Wordpress themes available online and took some of its code to create my own theme from scratch. jQuery Validation Plugin and some WP plugins were used, e.g. to create multiple language versions, deal with comments and surveys. I also used PHP and phpMyAdmin to manage MySQL databases, as well as xampp and its htdocs folder to develop locally.

The site is responsive, has some nice animations and two language versions to choose from. Additionally, adding texts and uploading photos is possible right through the Wordpress admin panel, which was adjusted by me.

Even though the web site looks and works quite well, putting it on GitHub is impossible, unless you generate a static page using a WP plugin... This does not make to much sense to me so I decided to modify and put here only the code I wrote, paste some photos of the web site and describe the project a little bit... As the site has photos, logos and texts connected with an existing company project, I had to add some placeholder photos and hide some content on the pictures.

Even though creating this web site was a useful experience which required much patience and thinking, I do not believe this is the best way to create web sites. I would definitely prefer to focus on React and other modern technologies.
